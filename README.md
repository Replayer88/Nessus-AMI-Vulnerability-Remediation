# Nessus-AMI-Vulnerability-Remediation
We will use Nessus to scan and remediate three vulnerabilities including a Shellshock vulnerability, an SMB Guest Account misconfiguration, and an anonymous FTP server misconfiguration.  

Nessus is a vulnerability scanner that can provide detailed information in regards to what vulnerabilities remain in a particular system and how to patch them. We will use a private Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that has multiple vulnerabilities with different degrees of severity. The vulnerable AMI is not provided over the internet to avoid any potential compromises. The Nessus file has been provided.
