# Nessus AMI Vulnerability Remediation
We will use Nessus to scan and remediate three vulnerabilities including a Shellshock vulnerability, an SMB Guest Account misconfiguration, and an anonymous FTP server misconfiguration.  

Nessus is a vulnerability scanner that can provide detailed information in regards to what vulnerabilities remain in a particular system and how to patch them. We will use a private Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that has multiple vulnerabilities with different degrees of severity. The vulnerable AMI is not provided over the internet to avoid any potential compromises. The Nessus file has been provided.

# Shellshock Vulnerability
Nessus was able to exploit the shellshock vulnerability by sending an HTTP GET request to the /cgi-bin/test.cgi script. The User-Agent header contains Bash commands that echo "Content-Type: text/plain", echo two blank lines, and then run /usr/bin/id. Shellshock could then be executed by creating an HTTP request and lead to a remote code execution vulnerability.

# SMB Guest Account Vulnerability
Nessus detected an insecure configuration that created the SMB guest account vulnerability. There is an SMB server named Samba that will allow anyone to access the files located on the server without any form of authentication. We can run “smbclient -U “%” \\\\<TARGET.IP.ADDRESS>\\\test” in Kali Linux to test the vulnerability. The -U “%” is providing a blank username and a blank password. This instantly gives us access to the SMB server and confirms that the vulnerability lives in this system.

# FTP Vulnerability
Nessus detected an insecure configuration that allows users to anonymously login to our FTP server. We can verify this by running “ftp -p <TARGET.IP.ADDRESS>”. We can enter anonymous as our username and instantly we are granted access.
